(1)Philosophy: C retains the philosophy that programmers know what they're doing as it only 
requires that they state their intentions explicitly. The development and evolution of C++'s life has been 
informally governed by a set of rules that it's evolution should follow.(e.g. User-created types need to have the same support and performance as built-in types)

Brevity: In C, This means shortness or conciseness in the style in which you write your code.
It is a neatly short and concise way of breifly minimizing your codes.

Clarity:This is the opposite from Brevity.This is a way of being clear and broad in the way you write your code.
In larger programs, there is an increase in clarity because larger programs are more complex.
Having clarity will enable future programmers to have knowledge about your code.

function implementations: There can be differences in the speed of functions in C++. This all depends on the 
type of the function. Example a function may not be returning anything (e.i. a void function).Other functions may be
returning value of a specific datatypes. Functions not returning any values will be faster. The parameter of a function
also plays a major role in terms of its speed. A function may be taking in as parameter/argument a pass by reference
or a pass by value. Pass by value meant that you have a local value of the data being past as a parameter and this
local value has no connections to the original value. The local and original value are both on a diffrent memory address.
Pass by reference meant that you are passing into a function a value that points to the same memory address as the 
original value. Any changes made by that value inside the function will reflect the original value. Pass by value will
be faster than pass by reference.In strcpy program, all functions are taking as a parameter/argument, a pointer which
points to a specific memory address the values are located. However some parameters are constant which means there
can be no change in the value at that specific memory address. Functions with constant parameter will be significantly
faster than those without a constant parameter.

#define:Preprocessor directives are lines included in the code of programs preceded by a hash sign (#). 
These lines are not program statements but directives for the preprocessor. The preprocessor examines the code 
before actual compilation of code begins and resolves all these directives before any code is actually generated 
by regular statements.
